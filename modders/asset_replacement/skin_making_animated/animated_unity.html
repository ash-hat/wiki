<p>So, you should have Unity 5.6.3 installed by now, right?</p>
<p>If this is your first time using it, do not panic, you'll only be needing it for two minutes, honestly.</p>
<p>That being said, lemme state a few rules to this process that I've discovered the hard way:</p>
<p><strong>Rule 1)</strong> Every animated skin you make, you need to make a new material for it. You CANNOT use the same material for two skins.</p>
<p>Using the same material on two skins will result in one skin being an abhorrent mess of the other skin's textures.</p>
<p><strong>Rule 2)</strong> Every Material you make, you need to include new, unused PNGs for it. You CANNOT use the same PNGs for two skins.</p>
<p>This mainly applies to Incandescence Maps. We'll be talking about scroll speeds soon, but if you use the same incan.png, than there will be only one speed, not two.</p>
<p>Lets get started.</p>
<p>Opening Unity should result in something like this. Lets begin by making a subfolder in this main folder, &quot;Assets&quot;, and I'll call this subfolder, &quot;am&quot; (for Animated Material)</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_1.png" alt="unity 1"></p>
<p>In this subfolder &quot;am&quot;, I'm going to make another folder based off of the skin I'm making. This subfolder will have my PNG exports.</p>
<p>The quick way would be to drag and drop your pngs in this category, but if you plan on making multiple animated skins, this will get clutter-some real quick.</p>
<p>Instead, make a copy of your exports, put them somewhere else, than add a codename to them.</p>
<p>After you give them a codename, import those pngs into the dedicated folder under <strong>Assets --&gt; am</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_2.png" alt="unity 2"></p>
<p>Yeah, making multiple animated skins, this is what it'll look like in the long run. Anyway...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_3.png" alt="unity 3"></p>
<p>So now that we have those pngs on Unity, go back to <strong>Assets</strong>...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_4.png" alt="unity 4"></p>
<p>Here is where I store my Animated Materials, and there is a reason behind it that we'll get to in the hotmodding step, but for now, follow my example.</p>
<p>Right click, and choose &quot;Create&quot;</p>
<p>A bunch of options will pop up, but we'll be looking for &quot;Material&quot;</p>
<p>A new material made, you're now going to want to look to the right.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_5.png" alt="unity 5"></p>
<p>The Shader set to &quot;Standard&quot; needs to be changed into &quot;Alloy/Core&quot;. Left click the shader...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_6.png" alt="unity 6"></p>
<p>And locate the category &quot;Alloy&quot;. Down this collection, look for &quot;Core&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_7.png" alt="unity 7"></p>
<p>Your information should now change to something far more simple than prior. Phew! Nothing too crazy here!</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_8.png" alt="unity 8"></p>
<p>Before we crack it open, we will need to add one more thing though. Look for the &quot;plus&quot; symbol next to the &quot;Add Tab&quot; category...</p>
<p>And select &quot;<strong>Emission</strong>&quot; to the categories.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_9.png" alt="unity 9"></p>
<p>Your result should be like this. Now, one more thing, there is a tint to this Emission category...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_10.png" alt="unity 10"></p>
<p>Bump that up to its max, at all white, for the full effect.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_11.png" alt="unity 11"></p>
<p>Alright! This material is ready to go!</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_12.png" alt="unity 12"></p>
<p>Now, it's not gonna be called &quot;new material&quot; forever, but this next step is important.</p>
<div class="WARNING">
<h5>Warning</h5>
<p>The name you give your material will be needed for the hotmodding step, so keep it simple!</p>
</div>
<p>Lowercase, underscores, and keep it small. All my animated materials start with &quot;tdam_&quot; but yours can be different.</p>
<p>For this example, my material is called &quot;tdam_puppet&quot;.</p>
<p>The only categories we'll be focused on in &quot;Main Textures&quot; and &quot;Emission&quot;, these are where those PNG exports will go</p>
<p>Right next to the empty spaces are tiny circles, select them...</p>
<p>A popup should appear. (This is where the codenames come in handy, use the search bar to aid you)</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_13.png" alt="unity 13"></p>
<p>Find the select pngs that go with each category. Base Color needs base color.png, Metal needs alloy.png, Normal needs normal.png--</p>
<p>Holup</p>
<p>When you apply the normal map, a prompt saying &quot;fix now&quot; appears. Tap that and we will continue</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_14.png" alt="unity 14"></p>
<p>Now, to the Emissive.</p>
<p>Mask needs emiss.png, and Effect needs incan.png--</p>
<p>STOP</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_15.png" alt="unity 15"></p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_16.png" alt="unity 16"></p>
<p>There is more to that Incandescence Map. Mainly, the scroll effect.</p>
<p>X and Y, X is horizontal scroll, and Y is vertical</p>
<p>X --&gt; -numbers go left, +numbers go right</p>
<p>Y --&gt; -numbers go down, +numbers go up</p>
<p>My example is .12 but yours can be anything else (within the limits between 0 and 1/-1)</p>
<p>If you forget this, your skin won't be animated, so don't forget!</p>
<p>Now that you have your pngs inside this material, lets address the elephant in the room.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_17.png" alt="unity 17"></p>
<p>Asset Bundles. &quot;None&quot; needs to go. You'll be renaming it to something else, and that name does matter, so I HIGHLY recommend you use the same name as your material.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_18.png" alt="unity 18"></p>
<p>Select &quot;New...&quot;, then name it as you will, but I'll be naming mine the same as the material.</p>
<p>Visit your pngs and include them in the same bundle as the one you made.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_19.png" alt="unity 19"></p>
<p>Lastly, there is something included with your template. The Core shader. That needs to be included as well, elsewise...</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_20.png" alt="unity 20"></p>
<p>This happens.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_oof.jpg" alt="unity oof"></p>
<p>So be sure you have included for every skin you make!</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_21.png" alt="unity 21"></p>
<p>Up above look for &quot;Window&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_22.png" alt="unity 22"></p>
<p>A lot of options come up, but you're going to be selecting &quot;<strong>AssetBundle Browser</strong>&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_23.png" alt="unity 23"></p>
<p>A new pop up will appear. Yours won't have as many categories, but the one we're focused on is the current bundle, which we named the same as our material, right?</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_24.png" alt="unity 24"></p>
<p>A good time to check to see if you have everything. Seven things: Material, Shader, and the five PNGs you have.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_25.png" alt="unity 25"></p>
<p>If you have these seven things, move on to the &quot;<strong>Build</strong>&quot; option.</p>
<p>Now, this is the Unity Export. The result will be a file that will be used for the hotmod, and this file will enable animated skins for that weapon.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_26.png" alt="unity 26"></p>
<p>That being said, another recommendation, make a folder called &quot;mat&quot; where you have your textures located.</p>
<p>Make this the place where you export. Back on Unity, browse and locate this &quot;mat&quot; folder, then build it.</p>
<p><img src="images/unity/unity_27.png" alt="unity 27"></p>
<p>It takes my computer a half a minute, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>Once built, you are all done!</p>
<p>Now... The hotmodding..</p>
<p>On to <a href="animated_hotmod.html">Animated Skins - Hotmodding</a>.</p>
