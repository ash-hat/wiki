<p>If you want to go the extra mile, you can make animated skins for H3VR as well. Before I explain how:</p>
<p>You'll be needing Unity in addition to what you currently have.</p>
<p>Oh, and Skinpacker won't work from this point on, sorry! You're going to need a ZIP Program!</p>
<p><a href="https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive">Unity 5.6.3f1</a> is the version I used (Unity 5.x category).</p>
<p>You'll also need a template for H3VR stuffs, here is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bRHZrJxgPmE1PJGR_ty3i78mBfLTZQiB/view?usp=sharing">one from PhoenixCraft99</a>.</p>
<p>Once you get these up and running, move on to the first step:</p>
<h2 id="step-1---enabling-emissions-for-substance-painter">Step 1 - Enabling Emissions for Substance Painter</h2>
<p>At this point it is recommended for you to be using Substance Painter, so that the tutorial can be easily understood and things move smoothly.</p>
<p>On Substance Painter, you should have your canvas open with the usual instructions (New Canvas with Normal Texture, Bake Maps, Include Normal post-bake)</p>
<p>There is one addition to this process for when you want to make animated skins.</p>
<p>Over on these texture set settings, click on the plus sign next to &quot;Channels</p>
<p><img src="images/sp_1.png" alt="sp 1"></p>
<p>Select &quot;Emissive&quot;</p>
<p><img src="images/sp_2.png" alt="sp 2"></p>
<p>Your result should look like this. With this, you have enabled Emissives for Substance Painter. Now, what to do with that...</p>
<p><img src="images/sp_3.png" alt="sp 3"></p>
<h2 id="step-2---applying-emissions-automatic-vs-custom">Step 2 - Applying Emissions (Automatic vs. Custom)</h2>
<p>Now, there are two ways you can add Emissions to your canvas.</p>
<p>The easier way is through Materials and Smart Materials, the <strong>Automatic</strong> choice.</p>
<p>Some SMs and Materials come with emissions included in them. (There is a starter pack with SMs and Materials included in Extras!)</p>
<p>Drag n Drop. Boom. Done. Easy.</p>
<p>However, if you have a bit more in mind, you can make your own <strong>Custom</strong> Emissives.</p>
<p>First, make a new layer dedicated to these emissions.</p>
<p><img src="images/emiss_1.png" alt="emmis 1"></p>
<p>Using the advanced tricks above, stamps and the material settings become handy. Notice the &quot;emiss&quot; selection? That's new, and that's what we'll need. Enable that, and if you want your stamp exclusively for the animated skin part, disable everything else,</p>
<p><img src="images/emiss_2.png" alt="emiss 2"></p>
<p>After doing this, painting anything now will be included in an Emission category, and the Alloy export you're used to will not detect these emissions.</p>
<p><img src="images/emiss_3.png" alt="emiss 3"></p>
<h2 id="step-3---exporting-twice">Step 3 - Exporting... Twice</h2>
<p>After you make a skin, you need to export it a bit differently, too. You'll need to export twice.</p>
<p>Once with the <strong>Alloy</strong> Preset.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_1.png" alt="export 1"></p>
<p>Then the next being with preset Document Channels.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_2.png" alt="export 2"></p>
<p>I recommend having these exports in separate locations. My Alloy was sent here, but my second export I placed in the &quot;emiss&quot; folder. Don't you like having things organized? Me too.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_3.png" alt="export 3"></p>
<p>Visiting said folder, this is what the export looks like. The only one we're interested in is our emission export, in which this example is called &quot;None_Emissive&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="images/export_4.png" alt="export 4"></p>
<p>I recommend renaming it to emiss before moving it with the alloy export. That's how you make an Emission! Now, the next part...</p>
<p><img src="images/export_5.png" alt="export 5"></p>
<h2 id="step-4---incandescence-the-map-of-animation">Step 4 - Incandescence, the map of Animation</h2>
<div class="NOTE">
<h5>Note</h5>
<p>The starter pack will include a bundle of Incandescence PNGs, so you can skip this part if you already have one that works with your skin.</p>
</div>
<p>To bring these emissions to light, you need a fifth png. A black and white png that scrolls through the Emissive texture in variating opacities, giving it that &quot;animated&quot; effect.</p>
<p>To make it, you could even use Microsoft Paint! But for this example, we'll be using Photoshop.</p>
<p>For most Incandescence Maps, they are 512 x 512, a fourth of the size of the exports.</p>
<p><img src="images/incan_1.png" alt="incan 1"></p>
<p>Start off with a black background, and make a picture of how you want your emissions revealed, then make that effect on here.</p>
<p><img src="images/incan_2.png" alt="incan 2"></p>
<p>This is my example of an incandescence map, yours can be different, but so long as it follows the same rules (black and white, 512 x 512) it should work.</p>
<p><img src="images/incan_3.png" alt="incan 3"></p>
<p>(If your canvas has a map that translates well, you could make a 2048 x 2048 map with variating Incandescence maps. However, this might not work for all canvases)</p>
<p>Save it as &quot;incan.png&quot; with the other four exports. Now that we have the last piece, we can move on to Unity!</p>
<p>Step 5 and 6 have been moved to their own pages.</p>
<p>On to <a href="animated_unity.html">Animated Skins - Unity</a>.</p>
